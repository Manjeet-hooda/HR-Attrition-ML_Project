Project Overview

This project tackles the critical business problem of HR attrition. By analyzing various employee-related features, a machine learning model is developed to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. This predictive capability can enable HR departments to implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately saving costs and improving employee satisfaction.

Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:
Train_Dataset.csv and Test_Dataset.csv1.

The Train_Dataset.csv contains 7810 entries and 22 columns, including:
EmployeeID 2


Attrition 3


Age 4


TravelProfile 5

The
Test_Dataset.csv has 2630 entries and 21 columns, with similar features to the training dataset but without the 'Attrition' column, as it is meant for prediction24.


Methodology

The project involves several key steps:
Data Loading: Train_Dataset.csv and Test_Dataset.csv are loaded into pandas DataFrames25.


Data Preprocessing:
Duplicate rows are dropped from the training dataset26.


EmployeeID column is dropped from both training and testing datasets as it is not relevant for model training27.


Missing values in the
Attrition column of the training set are filled with '1.0'28.


A 'data' column is added to differentiate between training and testing sets before concatenation29.


The training and testing datasets are concatenated for unified preprocessing30.


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): (Based on typical ML project flow, though specific EDA steps weren't detailed in the provided snippets, it's a standard practice)
Feature Engineering: (Likely performed, but specific details not available in snippets)
Model Training: (Specific model not identified, but the project builds a machine learning model)
Prediction: The trained model makes predictions on the test dataset.
Output Generation: The final predictions are saved to a CSV file named Final_output_for_Attrition.csv31.



Key Findings

The training dataset initially contains 7810 entries, with 5180 non-null values for
Attrition, indicating some missing values that were handled during preprocessing32.


The
Attrition column in the training data shows a distribution of 3735 instances of 0.0 (no attrition) and 1445 instances of 1.0 (attrition) before imputation of null values33.
