# HR-Attrition-Project

HR Attrition Analysis and Prediction

This project delves into employee attrition (turnover), aiming to understand the factors that influence why employees leave an organization. By analyzing HR data, we can:

Identify key drivers of attrition: Uncover the most significant factors contributing to employee exits, such as compensation, work-life balance, career growth opportunities, or management style.
Develop predictive models: Build machine learning or statistical models to predict which employees are at a higher risk of leaving. This foresight empowers proactive retention strategies.
Visualize trends and patterns: Explore data through informative visualizations to gain insights into attrition trends across departments, demographics, or job roles.
Project Goals

Reduce turnover costs: Retaining valuable talent saves the company money and time associated with recruitment and onboarding.
Improve employee engagement: By understanding factors that lead to disengagement, we can create a more engaging work environment.
Optimize HR practices: Data-driven insights can inform HR initiatives that foster a positive employee experience and enhance retention.
